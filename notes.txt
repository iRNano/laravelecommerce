Things to do when pulling a laravel project from git:

1.create .env file at the root directory of your project - duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to .env
2. set your database credentials in the new .env file
3. generate a new app key for your .env file via the terminal command:
	php artisan key:generate
4. install application dependencies via the terminal command: 
	composer install

*terminal commands have to be run from the project's root directory
**don't forget to run your migrations
