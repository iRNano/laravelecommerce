Things to do when pulling a laravel project from git:

1.create .env file at the root directory of your project - duplicate the .env.example file and rename it to .env
2. set your database credentials in the new .env file
3. generate a new app key for your .env file via the terminal command:
	php artisan key:generate
4. install application dependencies via the terminal command: 
	composer install

*terminal commands have to be run from the project's root directory
**don't forget to run your migrations

1. Setup the UI
	a. require laravel's ui -> composer require laravel/ui

		bootstrap.min.css
		jquery
		popper
		bootstrap.min.js
	c. create the user scaffolding -> php artisan ui:auth


Note:
Blade has two special checks if the user is logged in or not
@guest -- checks if the user IS NOT logged in
@else 
@endguest

@auth -- checks if the user IS logged in
@else
@endauth

Note:
Auth::user() -> session for the user

Checkout:
1. Create a new route for the confirm order
2. Create controller function that checks if the user logged in and if the user is logged in, proceed to getting the data from the card and set it to a new view
3. Create a view that contains a table for the summary of the order.
	name, description, price, qty, subtotal, total.
4. Add a button to confirm the order
*** Setup ***
Use php tinker to create  entries for the statuses table
php tinker -> allows php scripts to be run without the need for a server
recall product
$product = new Product;
$product->name = "value";
...
$product->save();


5. Create a new order
6. Populate the products_orders table
	a. check if there is a relationship from order to Product model (Many to many) -> 	belongsToMany

Middleware -> handles the flow of the resources, it would be able to allow or restrict access to the resource depending on the condition
